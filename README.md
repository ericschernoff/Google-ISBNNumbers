# NAME

Google::ISBNNumbers - Retrieve book info by ISBN number

# SYNOPSIS

    use Google::ISBNNumbers;
    
    $books = Google::ISBNNumbers->new($your_google_api_key);

    $isbn_number = 9781680500882; # may include dashes and spaces
    $book_info = $books->lookup_isbn( $isbn_number );

        # or, if you prefer
        $book_info = Google::ISBNNumbers->new($your_google_api_key)->lookup_isbn($isbn_number);

    # 'description','publication_date', and 'cover_link'
    say $$book_info{title}; # says 'Modern Perl'
    

# DESCRIPTION

This module uses the Google Books API to retrieve basic information on a book by its
ISBN Number.  The Google Books API seems to be more complete and reliable than other
resources for searching ISBN numbers.

You will need a Google API key from [https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
This requires setting up a basic 'Project' in that console, but no sensitive scopes are required,
so you should be able to get the key instantly.  You can read up on the Google Books API
here: [https://developers.google.com/books](https://developers.google.com/books)

This should be one of the simplest modules you'll encounter.  The synopsis above pretty 
much covers it. You pass your Google API key to new() and you pass a valid ISBN number
to lookup\_isbn(), and you get back a key-&lt;gt>value hash of basic info on your book.
FYI: The ISBN number should be found on the back cover, above the bar code, and
starts with '978'.
